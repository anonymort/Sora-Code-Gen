### Recommended Setup

For the best results, it is highly recommended to use the **Mozilla Firefox** browser and connect to a **VPN server located in the USA**. This helps to match the request headers that are most commonly accepted by the API.

## How It Works

1.  **Generates Codes**: The script creates random 6-character invite codes in the format `0A1B2C`.
2.  **Submits Codes**: It uses multiple threads to submit these codes to the Sora API as fast as possible.
3.  **Handles Responses**:
    *   If a code is **successful** (200 OK), it's saved to `success.txt`.
    *   If a code is **invalid** (403 Forbidden), it's saved to `invalid_codes.txt` and never tried again.
    *   If the script is **rate-limited** (429 Too Many Requests), it waits and retries.
    *   If your **authentication fails** (401 Unauthorized), the script will stop and tell you to update your token.
4.  **Smart Blacklist & Cache**: The script is intelligent. It uses `used_codes.txt` and `invalid_codes.txt` as a "blacklist cache". Every time it starts, it loads these files to ensure it **never tries the same code twice**, whether it was successful, invalid, or simply attempted before. This makes the script highly efficient, especially when you stop and restart it.

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps carefully to get the script running.

### Step 1: Initial Installation

1.  Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2.  Double-click the `install.bat` file. It will automatically create a virtual environment and install the necessary library.

### Step 2: Get Your Authentication Token (Firefox)

This is the most important step. The script needs your personal authentication token to work.

1.  Open **Mozilla Firefox** and log in to `https://sora.chatgpt.com`.
2.  Press the `F12` key to open the **Developer Tools**.
3.  Go to the **Network** tab.
4.  If the list is empty, refresh the page or navigate to `https://sora.chatgpt.com/explore`.
5.  In the filter box (üîç), type `sora` to show only requests to the Sora server.
6.  Click on any request in the list.
7.  On the right, find the **Headers** section and scroll down to **Request Headers**.
8.  Look for the `authorization` header. It will look like this:
    `authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
9.  **Copy the long string of characters** *after* the word `Bearer `.
10. Paste the token you copied into `auth.txt`. **Do not include `Bearer `**. Save the file.

### Step 3: Customize Script Parameters (Optional)

You can fine-tune the script's performance by editing the `params.txt` file.

-   `max_workers`: The number of threads used to submit codes. More threads can be faster but may increase the chance of being rate-limited.
-   `delay`: The pause (in seconds) between processing codes. A higher delay is safer.
-   `max_retries`: How many times the script will try to resubmit a code if it gets a rate-limit error.
-   `retry_delay`: The base time (in seconds) the script waits before retrying.

If you are unsure, the default values in `params.txt` are a good starting point.

### Step 4: Get Your Device ID and User Agent (Firefox)

The script needs to look like it's coming from your specific browser.

1.  In the same **Network** tab where you found your token, look for the `OAI-Device-Id` and `User-Agent` headers, usually below the auth token.
2.  Copy the values for both.
3.  Open the `config.txt` file that came with the script.
4.  Replace the placeholder values with your own `OAI-Device-Id` and `User-Agent`. Save the file.

### Step 5: Run the Script

Once you have completed the steps above, you are ready to run the script.

**On Windows:**
-   Double-click the `run.bat` file.

The script will start running and show you its progress. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it at any time.
